# [AOC2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024)_py

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2024, written in Python.

## Project Structure

Each day's puzzle is solved in a separate python file named `dayXX`, where `XX` is the day number. Each module contains two functions, `part1` and `part2`, which solve parts 1 and 2 of the day's puzzle, respectively.

## Running the Code

To run the code for a specific day and part, use the `python pyaoc.py` command followed by the day and part number. For example, to run the solution for day 1, part 1, you would use the following command:

```bash
python pyaoc.py 1 1
```

Test inputs can be executed by adding `_test` to the first number:

```bash
python pyaoc.py 1_test 1
```


## Input Data
The input data for each day's puzzle is read from a text file using a function from 'pyaoc.py'. The text files are named according to the day number and are located in the input directory 'puzzle_inputs'.
For the full input, it will be attempted to download it, thus save your __Session Cookie__ into a file named __session_cookie.txt__!
